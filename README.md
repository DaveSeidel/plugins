CSOUND PLUGINS
===

This repository will contain the code for Csound plugins which were in the main repository, and the code for new opodes as well.
This is actually very experimental and it should become effective with Csound7.

For now, it can be used to build different plugins and test them by manually copying the shared library generated for the plugin into the plugin directory of Csound. See for example the py opcodes for Python3.

# CSOUND PLUGINS

This repository will contain the code for Csound plugins. This is actually very experimental and it will become effective with Csound7.

For now, it can be used to build different plugins and test them by manually copying the shared library generated for the plugin into the plugin directory of Csound. See for example the py opcodes for Python3.
